% \caption{Industrial designers commonly decompose complex shapes into box-like primitives, which they refine by drawing cuts and roundings, or by adding and substracting smaller parts~\cite{eissen2007sketching,eissen2011sketching}~(a, \rev{$\copyright$Koos Eissen and
% Roselien Steur}). Users of \emph{Sketch2CAD} follow similar sketching steps (b), which our system interprets as parametric modeling operations (c) to automatically output a precise, compact, and editable CAD model (d).}
